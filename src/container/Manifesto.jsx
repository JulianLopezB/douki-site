            <p className='text-gray text-left text-1xl  mb-5'>
                We are excited to offer a unique shopping experience powered by OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) embeddings. Our platform allows you to search for clothing items using text prompts, and our CLIP model will match the text descriptions to the visual features of the images to retrieve the most relevant product pages.
            </p>
            <p className='text-gray text-left text-1xl  mb-5'>
                This means you can easily find the perfect piece of clothing in your favorite style, without having to spend hours scrolling through pages of products.
            </p>
            <p className='text-gray text-left text-1xl  mb-5'>
                In addition to our innovative search functionality, we also offer a wide selection of stylish and unique clothing items from top brands. We are committed to providing our customers with the best shopping experience possible, and we hope you enjoy using our platform.

            At our Dokus≈ç, we believe in the power of technology to enhance the shopping experience, but we also believe in the joy of using one's own creativity to shop for clothes. That's why we have implemented <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/" className="text-blue-700">OpenAI's CLIP</a> (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) embeddings to power our search functionality.

            With CLIP, finding the perfect piece of clothing is as easy as entering a few keywords and letting your creativity guide you. Our platform matches the text descriptions to the visual features of the images to retrieve the most relevant product pages, so you can find what you're looking for with ease.
            </p>
            <p className='text-gray text-left text-1xl  mb-5'>
